想看这本书：[The End of the World Is Just the Beginning](https://www.amazon.com/End-World-Just-Beginning-Globalization/dp/006323047X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)，由[Make Sense](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3dha2luZ3VwLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/YjQ0MWUyZGEtNjI5Ny00NDNhLThiMWEtOTg4NjIxOGNiMDFi?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjY95bCqoX5AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCg&hl=en) 播客推荐。虽然现在听英文播客还有些费力，而且也没有付费去看全集，但看了介绍还蛮感兴趣的。

最近发生的事情很多，疫情、战争、欧元日元贬值、能源紧张......想看一些关于近未来的分析，也有一些长期感兴趣的领域，都在中文领域较难找到有获得感的内容。慢慢看些英文内容吧。

### 简介

> A New York Times Bestseller!
2019 was the last great year for the world economy.
For generations, everything has been getting faster, better, and cheaper. Finally, we reached the point that almost anything you could ever want could be sent to your home within days - even hours - of when you decided you wanted it.

纽约时报畅销书。
2019 是世界经济最后的好日子。
几代人以来，一切都变得更快、更好、更便宜。 最后，我们到达一个这样的时刻：几乎任何你想要的东西都可以在你决定想要它的几天内（甚至几小时）内送到家中。

America made that happen, but now America has lost interest in keeping it going.
美国做到了这一点，但现在美国已经失去了继续保持下去的兴趣。

Globe-spanning supply chains are only possible with the protection of the U.S. Navy. The American dollar underpins internationalized energy and financial markets. Complex, innovative industries were created to satisfy American consumers. American security policy forced warring nations to lay down their arms. Billions of people have been fed and educated as the American-led trade system spread across the globe.
All of this was artificial. All this was temporary. All this is ending.
In The End of the World is Just the Beginning, author and geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan maps out the next world: a world where countries or regions will have no choice but to make their own goods, grow their own food, secure their own energy, fight their own battles, and do it all with populations that are both shrinking and aging.
The list of countries that make it all work is smaller than you think. Which means everything about our interconnected world - from how we manufacture products, to how we grow food, to how we keep the lights on, to how we shuttle stuff about, to how we pay for it all - is about to change.
In customary Zeihan fashion, rather than yelling fire in the geoeconomic theatre, he narrates the accumulation of matchsticks, gasoline, and dynamite in the hands of the oblivious audience, suggesting we might want to call the fire department.
A world ending. A world beginning. Zeihan brings readers along for an illuminating (and a bit terrifying) ride packed with foresight, wit, and his trademark irreverence.
